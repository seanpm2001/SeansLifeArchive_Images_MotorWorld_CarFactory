; For: seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_MotorWorld_CarFactory
; About:
; I have decided to make the Assembly language the second official language for this project, as the game in question is a game that involves heavy usage of an ASSEMBLY line, and aside from the rust, Assembly was chosen as the second project language file for this reason. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
