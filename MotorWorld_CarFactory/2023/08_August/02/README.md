## Hiatus has ended

My hiatus from this game has finally ended. It lasted from 2021, September 3rd to 2023, August 1st (697 days, or 1 year, 10 months, and 29 days) as previously stated in the event that I return to the game, images are now being placed in a separate repository.

- [:octocat: `Click/tap here to go the 2023 August image repository`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_MotorWorld_CarFactory_Y2023_V1/)

I have yet to resume Tiny Tower gameplay. The current repository will continue to receive daily updates, unless a decision to transition entirely is made.

## Last nights notes

Smurfs Village may be resumed simultaneously, but I prioritized this game first, as this game is not going to work well on newer versions of Android, and may completely stop working at some point. I want to get as far as possible. Smurfs Village can definitely wait, as that game is going nowhere right now, as it is still actively updated, while MW:CF has not been updated in about a decade

It took me almost 3 years, but I kept to my promise: I did return to the game

### Errata

Almost 2 years, not almost 3 years. Also, Smurfs Village was resumed immediately
