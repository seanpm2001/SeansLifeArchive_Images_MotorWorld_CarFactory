Smurfs Village isn't taking as much time anymore
Testing this game to see if it still works
Authentication issue, annoying, but not game breaking
Daily game status
Childhood memories
!-->

I started playing this game (Motor World: Car Factory) again tonight, as I wanted to test to see if it still worked. It was a game from my early childhood. Surprisingly, it is still functional. The only annoying part is that it constantly tells me that the game is "not authenticated" which is pretty annoying, but it still lets me play, and hasn't reset my progress yet. It is a Mobage game, and Mobage shut down most of their games in 2015, so this game hasn't been updated in years.

I decided to make this game a 2nd daily game, as the other game (Smurfs Village) doesn't have as much to do, and I want to document this game, as part of my life archive project. It is a good game. - August 5th 2021

I played further today, but didn't make too much progress. My money is going to start exponentiating, then I can start enjoying the game better. - August 6th 2021

Things aren't exponentiating as fast as I thought they would. Today was also a bit slow. - August 7th 2021

Things exponentiated a bit better today, and I had a good time playing, but quit without having too much fun. - August 8th 2021

Things exponentiated a lot today, and I am now not able to keep up with the current car, so I am going to have to start making more expensive vehicles tomorrow. - August 9th 2021

Things didn't exponentiate today, but I started producing more expensive cars today and doing several upgrades. I really enjoy this game. - August 10th 2021

Things went very poorly today. The "time monster" ate all my doughnuts and reset progress on all timed events, forcing me to adjust the price on all my cars again, and having to quit very early, as the game was just unplayable. I remember opening the game by accident earlier today, but quickly closing it. I am hoping that was the cause, so I don't have this repeat for tomorrow. - August 11th 2021

Things went better today, but gameplay was still slightly poor. I am now fixed on producing Sunny Roadsters, which give me over 15000 coins each, over 60000 coins per day total. My workers aren't powerful enough to go for something higher, and it would be too expensive at the moment. - August 12th 2021

Extra (2021, August 12th) I managed to glitch out some of my workers by moving them to places the game doesn't support them being at.

I played for a while today, my workers are really not efficient enough, and I am going through all my food supply daily, with very little room for upgrades. I hired my 4th worker today as well. Things went better today, but I still need to make more money. - August 13th 2021

The time monster came back today, I think it is due to attempting to get a screenshot of the title screen, as I attempted that on both incidents. It was actually very helpful tonight, as it helped me go to bed earlier. - August 14th 2021

I had a longer session and had a good time. I received 3 more new workers, produced several new cars, and began building my first structure that wasn't preloaded, but was unable to finish it today. I also upgraded my donut capacity, and improved the abilities of several workers. - August 15th 2021

I had a long session again tonight and had a good time. I was unable to finish building all the new cars tonight, as I focused on leveling up workers, and working on the car wash structure site. - August 16th 2021

I had a set of sessions today and had a good time. I played 3 times today, twice in the evening, and once before bed. I spent 2 sessions working on leveling up workers and getting my factory more up to date. I also renamed my factory and gave it is own logo. On my nighttime session, I did lots of area exploration, received my first 2 magic cards from the Gypsy shop and built several cars. I began building Berliner Donk cars, and I made progress, and did lots of worker upgrades. Finally, I made more progress on the car wash. - August 17th 2021

I had a set of sessions today and had a good time. I played 3 times today, twice in the evening, and once before bed. I spent 2 sessions working on leveling up workers and getting my factory more up to date. My game experienced a severe crash during my 2nd session, but nothing was lost. I produced more Berliner Donks today, and finished construction on my car wash. - August 18th 2021

I had a set of sessions today and had a good time. I played 3 times today, twice in the evening, and once before bed. I spent 2 sessions working on leveling up workers and getting my factory more up to date. - August 19th 2021 to August 20th 2021

I had only 2 sessions today, and had a good time. I placed onve in the afternoon, and once before bed. I spent the first session working on leveling up workers. Almost all my workers are level 5 or 6 now. During the end session, I ran out of donuts/dough-nuts and couldn't finish stocking up cars in the warehouse. - August 21st 2021

EXTRA: I forgot to include data for this game in my August 21st 2021 backup, and didn't upload it to GitHub on 2021, August 21st 2021. I saved that for the next day. - August 21st 2021

I made minor progress today, but fell asleep while playing and left my phone on all night. I only had 1 session today. I am really surprised it was only down to 28% battery upon waking up nearly 10 hours later. I was also able to upload data for today and yesterday today, as I included it in todays backup. - August 22nd 2021

I made more progress today across 2 sessions, and I got all my workers to level 5 or higher. I finally caught the Leprechaun for the first time today, and had a small gold shower. I was unable to produce all the cars needed today, and I used up 2 mystery cards. I eventually quit after running out of donuts and workers. - August 23rd 2021

I made more progress today across 2 sessions. I eventually quit after running out of donuts and workers. - August 24th 2021

I made lots of progress today across 3 sessions. I got my 8th worker today, and upgraded to a set of 11 workers, and threw away all the progress on my original worker when merging with a new engineer. I am wondering now, what is the point of worker upgrades? I also finished construction on the refill station today, and began building a stadium. - August 25th 2021

I made some progress today across 3 sessions. I did some worker upgrades, accepted my first quest, destroyed a zombie outbreak, and worked further on building a racing stadium. - August 26th 2021
