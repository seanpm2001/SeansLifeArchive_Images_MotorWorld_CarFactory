Smurfs Village isn't taking as much time anymore
Testing this game to see if it still works
Authentication issue, annoying, but not game breaking
Daily game status
Childhood memories

I started playing this game (Motor World: Car Factory) again tonight, as I wanted to test to see if it still worked. It was a game from my early childhood. Surprisingly, it is still functional. The only annoying part is that it constantly tells me that the game is "not authenticated" which is pretty annoying, but it still lets me play, and hasn't reset my progress yet. It is a Mobage game, and Mobage shut down most of their games in 2015, so this game hasn't been updated in years.

I decided to make this game a 2nd daily game, as the other game (Smurfs Village) doesn't have as much to do, and I want to document this game, as part of my life archive project. It is a good game. - August 5th 2021

I played further today, but didn't make too much progress. My money is going to start exponentiating, then I can start enjoying the game better. - August 6th 2021

Things aren't exponentiating as fast as I thought they would. Today was also a bit slow. - August 7th 2021

Things exponentiated a bit better today, and I had a good time playing, but quit without having too much fun. - August 8th 2021

### Cars

I produced 3 cars, but ran out of money. I don't care how expensive they are, I can wait multiple days for them to sell. I can be the Apple Inc. of cars here (low quality, high price) the game is interesting. - August 5th 2021

I produced 3 more cars again today, then ran out of money. I should get at least 6500 coins after they sell. - August 6th 2021

I produced 3 more cars again today, then ran out of money. I should get at least 8000 coins after they sell. - August 7th 2021

I produced 4 more cars again today, then ran out of money. I should get at least 9200 coins after they sell. - August 8th 2021

### Level progress

I leveled up from level 1 to level 5 today. - August 5th 2021

I leveled up from level 5 to level 7 today. - August 6th 2021

I leveled up from level 7 to level 9 today. - August 7th 2021

I leveled up from level 9 to level 11 today. - August 8th 2021

### Worker level

I got a few of my workers to level 2 and 3, to make the game more efficient. - August 5th 2021

I did lots of upgrades to my workers today. I need to start increasing my doughnut counter. - August 6th 2021

I did lots of upgrades to my workers today. I started upgrading my doughnut counter, but it is a very expensive process. - August 7th 2021

I did some worker upgrades today, but didn't make too much progress on this. - August 8th 2021

### Car breeding

What... the... f-...

I discovered the breeding process today, couldn't it be called something else? This is really weird. - August 6th 2021

It hasn't resulted in anything yet, I don't know what happened. - August 7th 2021

### Short on coins

I am short on coins, I just started the game, and I haven't sold more than 1 car yet. I am slowly working on fixing this, there should be more progress on this tomorrow. - August 5th 2021

I am still low on coins, but I am exponentiating my funds. - August 6th 2021

I am still low on coins, exponentiation isn't going as planned. - August 7th 2021

I am still low on coins, exponentiation isn't going as planned, but it is picking up. - August 8th 2021

### Advertising

There are no ads in this game or the ad servers are down for good. - As of August 5th 2021 to August 8th 2021

### Enjoyment

My enjoyment for this game was moderate today. It will get more exciting when there is less tutorial, and more coins. - August 5th 2021

My enjoyment for this game was higher today. It will get a lot higher when I start making an adequate amount of coins. - August 6th 2021

My enjoyment for this game was slightly lower today. It will get a lot higher when I start making an adequate amount of coins. - August 7th 2021
