Smurfs Village isn't taking as much time anymore
Testing this game to see if it still works
Authentication issue, annoying, but not game breaking
Daily game status
Childhood memories
!-->

I started playing this game (Motor World: Car Factory) again tonight, as I wanted to test to see if it still worked. It was a game from my early childhood. Surprisingly, it is still functional. The only annoying part is that it constantly tells me that the game is "not authenticated" which is pretty annoying, but it still lets me play, and hasn't reset my progress yet. It is a Mobage game, and Mobage shut down most of their games in 2015, so this game hasn't been updated in years.

I decided to make this game a 2nd daily game, as the other game (Smurfs Village) doesn't have as much to do, and I want to document this game, as part of my life archive project. It is a good game. - August 5th 2021

I played further today, but didn't make too much progress. My money is going to start exponentiating, then I can start enjoying the game better. - August 6th 2021

Things aren't exponentiating as fast as I thought they would. Today was also a bit slow. - August 7th 2021

Things exponentiated a bit better today, and I had a good time playing, but quit without having too much fun. - August 8th 2021

Things exponentiated a lot today, and I am now not able to keep up with the current car, so I am going to have to start making more expensive vehicles tomorrow. - August 9th 2021

Things didn't exponentiate today, but I started producing more expensive cars today and doing several upgrades. I really enjoy this game. - August 10th 2021

Things went very poorly today. The "time monster" ate all my doughnuts and reset progress on all timed events, forcing me to adjust the price on all my cars again, and having to quit very early, as the game was just unplayable. I remember opening the game by accident earlier today, but quickly closing it. I am hoping that was the cause, so I don't have this repeat for tomorrow. - August 11th 2021

### Cars

I produced 3 cars, but ran out of money. I don't care how expensive they are, I can wait multiple days for them to sell. I can be the Apple Inc. of cars here (low quality, high price) the game is interesting. - August 5th 2021

I produced 3 more cars again today, then ran out of money. I should get at least 6500 coins after they sell. - August 6th 2021

I produced 3 more cars again today, then ran out of money. I should get at least 8000 coins after they sell. - August 7th 2021

I produced 4 more cars again today, then ran out of money. I should get at least 9200 coins after they sell. - August 8th 2021

I produced 4 more cars again today, then ran out of space. I should get at least 10500 coins after they sell. - August 9th 2021

I produced 4 more cars again today, then ran out of space. I should get at least 10500 more coins after they sell. - August 10th 2021

The game screwed up today and reset progress on my vehicles. I am not waiting ~7 hours for my cars to sell, so I quit early. - August 11th 2021

### Level progress

I leveled up from level 1 to level 5 today. - August 5th 2021

I did not level up today. - August 11th 2021

### Worker level

I got a few of my workers to level 2 and 3, to make the game more efficient. - August 5th 2021

I did lots of upgrades to my workers today. I need to start increasing my doughnut counter. - August 6th 2021

I did lots of upgrades to my workers today. I started upgrading my doughnut counter, but it is a very expensive process. - August 7th 2021

I did some worker upgrades today, but didn't make too much progress on this. - August 8th 2021

I did some worker upgrades today, and got a level 5 engineer. I also did more doughnut counter upgrades, but I found that after a few upgrades, it starts requiring the premium cash currency, so it is going to be more difficult now. - August 9th 2021

I did some worker upgrades today, but went broke in the process. - August 10th 2021

I didn't do any upgrades today. - August 11th 2021

### Car breeding

What... the... f-...

I discovered the breeding process today, couldn't it be called something else? This is really weird. - August 6th 2021

It hasn't resulted in anything yet, I don't know what happened. - August 7th 2021

No recent activity in car breeding. - August 8th 2021 to August 11th 2021

### Short on coins

I am short on coins, I just started the game, and I haven't sold more than 1 car yet. I am slowly working on fixing this, there should be more progress on this tomorrow. - August 5th 2021

I am still low on coins, but I am exponentiating my funds. - August 6th 2021

I am still low on coins, exponentiation isn't going as planned. - August 7th 2021

I am still low on coins, exponentiation isn't going as planned, but it is picking up. - August 8th 2021

I am starting to do well with coins, as exponentiation has improved significantly. - August 9th 2021

I am doing well with coins, but exponentiation will only continue when I start producing more powerful vehicles, which I am now doing. - August 10th 2021

I did poorly today, and had to quit early. - August 11th 2021

### Advertising

There are no ads in this game or the ad servers are down for good. - As of August 5th 2021 to August 11th 2021

My enjoyment for this game was moderate today. It will get more exciting when there is less tutorial, and more coins. - August 5th 2021
